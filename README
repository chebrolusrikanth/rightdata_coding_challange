# Metadata Service

A lightweight metadata management service similar to modern data governance platforms.

## Features
- Dataset registration using fully qualified name (FQN)
- Dataset-to-dataset lineage tracking
- Cycle detection in lineage graph
- Priority-based search across datasets
- REST APIs built with FastAPI

## Tech Stack
- FastAPI
- MySQL
- SQLAlchemy
- Alembic
- Docker & Docker Compose

## Architecture Decisions
- Dataset FQN used as unique identifier
- Lineage modeled as directed graph
- Cycle detection implemented using DFS
- Search results ranked by relevance priority

## Search Priority
1. Table name
2. Column name
3. Schema name
4. Database name

## Assumptions & Limitations
- Dataset-level lineage only
- Case-insensitive search
- No authentication (out of scope)

## Running Locally (Without Docker)
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
